# ptk
Ptk is a GUI toolkit that I have been working on for a while now. At the moment, it only has a few widgets available; however you can still make basic applications with it.

## building
To build, type `make` in the toplevel directory.

## themes
Basic theming is available through xml theme config files; currently, however, the name of the current theme file is hard coded into the library.

## using
I am planning on making some documentation, but I recommended just taking a look at the `test.c` example for now; it has most of the things that I have been working on already being used.
